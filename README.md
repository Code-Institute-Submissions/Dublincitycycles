## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find the tour that suits me and my party best. 
        3. I want to be able to see pictures of the routes & bikes to get a taste for what a tour might be like.
        4. I want to see previous customer testimonials and reviews. 
        5. I want to be able to view their social media accounts to see more picutures and hear more stories from previous customers. 

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to rebook easily and follow DCC on social media. 
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the company for any follow up info I may need after a tour. 
        

    -   #### Frequent User Goals

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours I used for my site are a pink, gray and black. I think the pink stands out nicely on the gray background and the black info text provides clearly legible information for customers.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The two types of font used are Bebasneueregular & Barlow. The Bebasneueregular is used for headings and larger text. I love this text as I feel it has a streamlined feel to it, which represents the 
            speed at which we will travel on our cycling tours. It is easily legible and attractive for customers. The Barlow text is more formal and contrasts beautifully with the Bebasneueregular.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is a very important part of my site. I am trying to sell the customers scenic tours around Dublin, so I chose to have a big, bold hero image of Dublin City to greet new & returning
            customers to the site. I added a gallery and some overhead shots of the routes to show the customer what they can expect to experience on a DCC tour.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor and prospective customer, I want to easily understand what tours this site offers for cyclists looking to explore Dublin

        1.1. Upon landing on the site customers can see a snapshot of what to expect during a tour on our large hero image. A simple scroll will offer them more info about DCC
            and the routes page will give more details about the routes we offer. 

    <img src="/documentation/mobile.png">

    2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find the tour that suits me and my party best. 

        2.1. The ever present nav-bar makes navigation easy for potential customers. 
        2.2. Footer links are also available for customers on each page.  
        
    3. I want to be able to see pictures of the routes & bikes to get a taste for what a tour might be like.

        3.1. The routes page of the site contains a detailed description of each route, along with a picture of that route.
        3.2. The routes page also contains a gallery of vivid images of the four routes.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to rebook easily and follow DCC on social media. 

        1.1. Returning visitors will be able to rebook a tour in a matter of seconds, via the 'book now' call to action button the home page hero image.
        1.2. Alternatively, returning visitors can navigate throughout the site at ease if further research of routes is required before rebooking. This can be done
             by engaging the nav-bar at the top of the page or using the link to routes at the bottom of the home page.
        1.3. Following us on social media couldn't be easier, with links to all of our accounts available at the bottom of every page of the site.
