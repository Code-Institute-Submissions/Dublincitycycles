Welcome to Dublin Coastal & City Cycles - By Brendan Lynch

Overview:

This is my first milestone project for the Code Institute. The projects specifications are to create a fully functioning webpage 
using HTML, CSS & applicable frameworks. The chosen site is something I have a keen interest in - cycling, and allowed me to have
 some fun while creating this project. I tried to keep things relatively simple, as this is my first time building a site. I used
 bootstrap quite a bit to assist me in developing a mobile first site. 

User Experience:

As this site is designed for tourists, or for Irish people who are looking for something new, I tried to keep the site as easy to 
navigate and 'to the point' as possible. I also included many visuals to entice perspective customers to book a tour with us. 
The site is consistent in how it is presented, with each page having a nav bar and footer - both of which have links to other pages.
The font familys chosen (bebas and barlow) are both easily legible. Bebas is used for headings/subheadings and is quite sleek and stylish
in appearance. I have chosen contrasting colours of black and bright red/pink to really grab the users attention and offer an attractive
look throughout the site.
